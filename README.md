# Intro
Different extensions use personal data in different ways. This privacy policy encompasses general principles of how extensions I create collect and handle personal data. Individual extensions, when you first use them, will display their own unique privacy policies and ask you to agree to them before continued use.

# Data Collection
Bearead.io chrome extension does not collect or store any data at all. It reads the user's current page content and process all its content locally in the browser. It currently does not need to store any data to work. The only time when any information is transmitted to outside the user's environment, is when a user clicks on a new vocabulary. A web request will be sent to official Google Translate API and the translated result will be displayed on screen. There is no step in this process when anything is transmitted to anywhere else.

of the extensions I write collect any data at all. Since no data is collected, it stands to reason, and is, indeed, the case, that none of your data can be sold to third parties.

That being said, there are a few other ways your data is used.


# Changes to the Privacy Policy
If there are substantive1 changes made to this blanket privacy policy or to the individual privacy policies of any of my extensions, I will push out a new version of the affected extension(s) and ask you to agree to the amended privacy policy.

If you have questions or concerns about this privacy policy, feel free to send me an email bearead_help@gmail.com or file an issue to this repository.
